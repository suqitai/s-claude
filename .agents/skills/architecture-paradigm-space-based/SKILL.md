# The Space-Based Architecture Paradigm


## When To Use

- High-traffic applications needing elastic scalability
- Systems requiring in-memory data grids

## When NOT To Use

- Low-traffic applications where distributed caching is overkill
- Systems with strong consistency requirements over availability

## When to Employ This Paradigm
- When traffic or state volume overwhelms a single database node.
- When latency requirements demand in-memory data grids located close to processing units.
- When linear scalability is required, achieved by partitioning workloads across many identical, self-sufficient units.

## Adoption Steps
1. **Partition Workloads**: Divide traffic and data into processing units, each backed by a replicated data cache.
2. **Design the Data Grid**: Select the appropriate caching technology, replication strategy (synchronous vs. asynchronous), and data eviction policies.
3. **Coordinate Persistence**: Implement a write-through or write-behind strategy to a durable data store, including reconciliation processes.
4. **Implement Failover Handling**: Design a mechanism for leader election or heartbeats to validate recovery from node loss without data loss.
5. **Validate Scalability**: Conduct load and chaos testing to confirm the system's elasticity and self-healing capabilities.

## Key Deliverables
- An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) detailing the chosen grid technology, partitioning scheme, and durability strategy.
- Runbooks for scaling processing units and for recovering from "split-brain" scenarios.
- A monitoring suite to track cache hit rates, replication lag, and failover events.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Eventual Consistency Issues**:
  - **Mitigation**: Formally document data-freshness Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and implement compensation logic for data that is not immediately consistent.
- **Operational Complexity**:
  - **Mitigation**: The orchestration of a data grid requires mature automation. Invest in production-grade tooling and automation early in the process.
- **Cost**:
  - **Mitigation**: In-memory grids can be resource-intensive. Implement aggressive monitoring of utilization and auto-scaling policies to manage costs effectively.

## Concrete Components

These vocabulary items name the concrete tools and abstractions
that show up when the paradigm is implemented. They are not
required dependencies and they are not part of the skill's
``tools:`` frontmatter (which is reserved for Claude Code tool
restrictions). Use this list to disambiguate during architecture
discussions.

- ``data-grid-platform``: Hazelcast, Apache Ignite, or similar; in-memory partitioned data store
- ``replication-manager``: moves writes asynchronously to durable storage and across regions
- ``load-tester``: drives the grid past its single-region ceiling to validate scale-out
